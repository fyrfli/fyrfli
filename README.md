- 👋 Hi, I’m @fyrfli
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of things. I have been a database and system administrator and now trying to expand my skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front End Development on Udemy.com
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment. Still learning.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can shoot me a message on here (I think).
