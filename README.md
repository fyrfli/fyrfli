# 👋🏾 Hi, I’m @fyrfli 

&#x1f913; My real name is Camille Frantz. I was born in 🇯🇲[Kingston, Jamaica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Jamaica) and am now living in 🇺🇸[Missouri, United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri) with my retired Military husband and 3 🐕puppers.

&#x1f615; I am a programmer who became a system and database administrator, who then did some writing and editing, which then turned into facilitative mediation, which led to a social work degree before I realised my calling was right back where I started neck-deep in code.

👀 I'm curious by nature so I dig deep and learn about all sorts of things. I've taught myself git (just enough to manage my own code), docker (just enough to run a few self-hosted apps including Gitlab), nginx (necessary to host my own websites and a reverse proxy), caddy (same as nginx) among other tools. I spend my days working on my self-hosted projects and learning more python, html, css, and javascript.

❤️ When I am not coding, I am playing 🎮video games or 📖reading or 📺binge watching some true crime series or movies. I've also been known to take 📷photographs.

👍 Some of my favourite resources are:

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org)
