- 👋 Hi, I’m @fyrfli
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of things. I have been a database and system administrator and now trying to expand my skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front End Development on Udemy.com
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment. Still learning.
- 📫 How to reach me: check out my profile - my email address is there.
- ✍🏾 I am currently storing my projects locally at https://gitlab.fyrf.li/camille and https://gitlab.fyrf.li/fyrfli

Until I set up a homepage and organise my projects hierarchically, here a couple projects I have been working on in my spare (ha!) time:

- [Shadows and transformations](https://fyrfli.io/shadows) - inspired by my [current Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/102wPk3@V44xa8SAYgt3sRQCSBh0H4ahw8JCnkNaNMPYqn3YmDnghdn6JQaJRvgLE3IMHuBdcQ==/)
- [Frontend Mentor QR Code Component challenge](https://fyrfli.io/qr-code-component)
- [Grids](https://fyrfli.io/grids-one) - inspired by my [next Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7)

Stay tuned for me.
