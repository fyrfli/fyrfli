- 👋 Hi, I’m @fyrfli
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of things. I have been a database and system administrator and now trying to expand my skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front End Development on Udemy.com
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment. Still learning.
- 📫 How to reach me: check out my profile - my email address is there.
- ✍🏾 Check out my [newly created portfolio page](https://fyrfli.io). It's a first draft but I welcome advice, suggestions, and recommendations.
