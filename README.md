# 👋 Hi, I’m @fyrfli

&#x1f913; My real name is Camille Frantz 

&#x1f615; I am a programmer who became a system and database administrator, who then did some writing and editing, which then turned into facilitative mediation which led to a social work degree before I realised my calling was right back where I started neck-deep in code.

👀 I'm curious by nature so I dig deep and learn about all sorts of things.

🌱 I’m currently learning Front End Development on Udemy.com
💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment. Still learning.
📫 How to reach me: check out my profile - my email address is there.
✍🏾 I'm working on a [chronicle of my journey](https://camille.fyrfli.io) from hobby coder to professional web developer.
